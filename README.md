## Project Description
[Project Specifications](https://github.com/nss-evening-cohort-05/spa-milestone-challenge-Sanyyouisf/blob/master/instructions.md)

##Instructions

1. Create an array of cars in the inventory.json file (see example structure below). Put at least three cars in the array.
2. When your page first loads, you need to use an XHR to load the contents of the JSON file, and parse them into a native JavaScript object.
3. Loop over your array of cars and build up an HTML string to build a card for each car. Also, use Bootstrap to create rows. Each row should contain 3 columns. Make sure you have a parent element with a class of container. Hint: You must build up the entire string of columns/rows before injecting into the DOM. Use a counter variable to know when to close a row after three columns.
4. Put a standard Bootstrap navbar element at the top of your page.
5. Put a text input field in the navigation bar.
6. Make sure you display all properties of the car in the DOM. Basic styling is up to you.
7. Make sure that each car card element has a CSS class which adds a black border around it.
8 .When you click on one of the car elements, change the width of the border to a higher value, and change the background color to any other color of your choosing.
9. Also, on click of the car element, clear the value of the text input in the navbar, and put the cursor in the text input.
10. When you start typing into the navbar's text input, the description, and only that property, of the currently selected car should be bound to what you are typing in and match it exactly.
